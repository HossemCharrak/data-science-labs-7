# Practical Training Series on Software Engineering for Data Science: Lab 7

This repository contains materials for **Notebook 7: Data Processing & Cleaning for Data Science** from the practical training series by Dr. Belkacem Khaldi. It focuses on advanced Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization techniques.

## Overview

This notebook serves as a hands-on guide to:

- **Explore and clean datasets**.
- **Visualize data for insights**.
- **Identify correlations** and patterns using advanced EDA methods.

The lab uses the **iTunes dataset**, located in the `/data` folder, as the primary example.

## Objectives

1. Perform EDA using visualization techniques rather than basic procedures.
2. Summarize findings, highlighting correlations and data patterns.
3. Produce a clean dataset suitable for further analysis.

## Instructions

1. Load the iTunes dataset from the `/data` directory.
2. Apply the techniques covered in Lecture 7 to:
   - Clean the data.
   - Visualize key insights.
   - Identify correlations between variables.
3. Summarize your findings in a report.

## Requirements

- **Python** and **Jupyter Notebook**.
- Key libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - Any other visualization libraries as needed (requirements.txt).

## Deliverables

- A cleaned version of the iTunes dataset.
- Visualizations highlighting key insights and correlations.
- A short summary report of EDA results.
